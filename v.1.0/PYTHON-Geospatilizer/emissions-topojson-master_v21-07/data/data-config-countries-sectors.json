				    "data-details-and-limitations": "In this report fossil CO2 emissions include sources from fossil fuel use (combustion, flaring), industrial processes (cement, steel, chemicals and urea) and product use. Please note that in the analysis presented in this report no short cycle carbon CO2 is included in any sector. GHG emissions comprise fossil CO2, CH4, N2O and F-gases. EDGARv5.0 uses international activity data, mainly energy balance statistics of IEA (2017) for 1970-2015 to estimate CO2 from fossil fuel consumption. These emissions are extended (FT approach) up to 2018 using BP statistics keeping the same sectoral breakdown. Updates for 2016, 2017 and 2018 for cement, lime, ammonia and ferroalloys production are based on USGS statistics, urea production and consumption are based on IFA statistics, associated gas used from flaring from GGFR/NOAA, steel production from world steel and cement clinker production from UNFCCC (2019).  GHG emissions are estimated entirely using stable statistics and no Fast-Track approach is applied. Therefore GHG emissions are available until the year 2015"
