## Short description

### What's the problem?

### How can technology help?


  ## TO HONESTLY TALK TO YOU:
  THIS COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
  IF WE HAVE A TRUE LOCATED VIRTUAL TWIN WITH ALL THE INFORMATION ACCESSIBLE AMD OBVIOS TO ANYONE, IF WE COMBINE THE STATEW SPACES, WE CAN AUGMENT

## Project roadmap

### TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES
#### Basic technology
#### IBM technology


### ROADMAP

See below for our proposed schedule on next steps after Call for Code 2021 submission.

![Roadmap](./images/roadmap.jpg)

#### Versions
##### v.0.1 Static Data Implementation - BASIC DATA SETS (geospatial  + emission data)


##### v.1.0 Dynamic Realtime Data Implementation - Towards Complete DATA SETS (geospatial + /scopes(combined climate / earth science / glocal datasets))

##### v.2.0

##### v.3.0 - XR Potential




#### IMPLEMENTATION STAGE

#### with Fraunhofer FOKUS + narimo systems


The project currently does the following things.

- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3

It's in a free tier IBM Cloud Kubernetes cluster. In the future we plan to run on Red Hat OpenShift, for example.


#### TODO / OUTLOOK



#### with IBM & potential investor



## Getting started

instructions to run project on  local machine for development and testing purposes and how to deploy the project in production.
